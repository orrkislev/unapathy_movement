        <div><b>UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is a call to move!</b></div>
        <div>
            This project is aiming for those who feel sometimes overwhelmed by the world around them . As volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity are rising, and affecting our daily motivation to stay active, pushing us towards apathetic behavior, which is expressed by moments of passivity during our daily interaction with computers. A work session of 3 hours in front of the screen is stretched and drawn into a 4-5 hours of screen time, as we check out our Facebook profile, watch a short Youtube, refresh the news or even move on to watch a full episode or two on Netflix. Is that what you aim to do with your leisure?
        </div>
        <div>
            Media and technology conglomerates are designing means of hooking our passive behavior and feed us with more content. UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is a tool for self reflection, aiming to untie these automated hooks, and allowing us to make sober decision of what to do with our spare time.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>How does it work?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The tool is composed out of two actions: recognition and activation. 
            The recognition console is tracking your body, head and gaze movement using your webcam, evaluating your screen time and counting your passive moments.
        <div>
            As your apathy-bar reach 45 minutes of passive moments, the second action appears: It ia a call for a play. You are invited to learn how to juggle with 3 balls, to Hula Hoop or to slackline. Each of the activities can be learned step by step. Every 45 Minutes of full apathy bar,  you should move and practice as much as you need to in order to feel reactivated. The apathy-bar restarts.

            UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is utilizing our body learning mechanisms in order to increase general self efficacy, decreasing apathetic behavior.
            Studies point out a two way channel between body and brain regarding physical activity and mood. It is studied that playful Physical activity that combines the moderate acquisition of a skill is particularly effective in increasing general self-efficacy and thus enabling us to return to action.

        <div><i>“Objectively, that is, seen from the outside and without taking into account that man is a beginning and a beginner, the chances that tomorrow will be like yesterday are always overwhelming. Not quite so overwhelming, to be sure, but very nearly so as the chances were that NO earth would ever rise out of cosmic occurrences, that NO life would develop out of inorganic processes, that NO man would emerge out of the evolution of animal life. The decisive difference between the “infinite improbabilities” on which the reality of our earthly life rests and the miraculous character inherent in those events which establish historical reality is that, in the realm of human affairs, we know the author of the “miracles.” It is men who perform them— men who because they have received the twofold gift of freedom and action can establish a reality of their own.”</i></div>
