        <div>
            This project is aiming for those who feel sometimes overwhelmed
            by the world around them. As volatility, uncertainty, complexity
            and ambiguity are rising, and affecting our daily motivation to
            stay active, pushing us towards apathetic behavior, which is
            expressed by moments of passivity during our daily interaction
            with computers.
            A work session of 3 hours in front of the screen is stretched
            and drawn into a 4-5 hours of screen time, as we check out our
            Facebook profile, watch a short Youtube, refresh the news or even
            move on to watch a full episode or two on Netflix. Is that what you
            aim to do with your leisure?
        </div>
        <div>
            Media and technology conglomerates are designing means of
            hooking our passive behavior and feed us with more content. UN_
            APATHY MOVEMENT is a tool for self reflection, aiming to untie
            these automated hooks, and allowing us to make sober decision
            of what to do with our spare time.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>How does it work?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The tool is composed out of two actions: recognition and
            activation.
            The recognition console is tracking your body, head and gaze
            movement using your webcam, evaluating your screen time and
            counting your passive moments.
        </div>
        <div>
            As your apathy-bar reach 45 minutes of passive moments, the
            second action appears: It ia a call for a play. You are invited to
            learn how to juggle with 3 balls, to Hula Hoop or to slackline. Each
            of the activities can be learned step by step. Every 45 Minutes of
            full apathy bar, you should move and practice as much as you
            need to in order to feel reactivated. The apathy-bar restarts.

            UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is utilizing our body learning
            mechanisms in order to increase general self efficacy, decreasing
            apathetic behavior.
            Studies point out a two way channel between body and brain
            regarding physical activity and mood. It is studies that playful
            Physical activity that combines the moderate acquisition of a skill
            is particularly effective in increasing general self-efficacy and thus
            enabling us to return to action.
