        <div><b>UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is a call to move!</b></div>
        <div>
            This project is meant for those who sometimes feel overwhelmed by the world around them. Volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity are rising and affecting our daily motivation to stay active, pushing us towards apathetic behavior, which is expressed by moments of passivity during our daily interaction with computers. A work session of three hours in front of the screen is stretched and drawn into four to five hours of screen time, as we disengage, loose focus, and gravitate towards checking out our Facebook profile, watching a short Youtube, the news or even a full episode or two on Netflix. Is that what you aim to do with your leisure?
        </div>
        <div>
            Media and technology conglomerates are designing means of hooking our passive behavior and feeding us with more content.  UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is a tool for self reflection, aiming to untie these automated hooks, and
            allowing us to make sober decision of what to do with our spare time.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>How does it work?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The tool is composed of two actions: recognition and activation. The recognition console tracks your body, head, and gaze movement using your webcam, evaluating your screen time and counting your passive moments.
            <div>
                Studies recommend moving and physical practice every 45 minutes or so, in order to feel reactivated and avoid the effects of accumulated apathy. As your apathy-bar reaches 15 minutes of passive moments, the second action appears: It is a call for a play. You are invited to learn how to juggle balls, to Hula Hoop, or to slackline. Each of the activities can be learned step by step. After fulfilling the activity the apathy-bar restarts.

            <div>
                UN_APATHY MOVEMENT is utilizing our body’s learning mechanisms in order to increase general self-efficacy, decreasing apathetic behavior. Studies point out a two-way channel between body and brain regarding physical activity and mood. It is shown that playful physical activity that calls for the moderate acquisition of a skill is particularly effective in increasing general self-efficacy and thus enabling us to return to action.

            <div><i>“Objectively, that is, seen from the outside and without taking into account that man is a beginning
                    and a beginner, the chances that tomorrow will be like yesterday are always overwhelming. Not quite
                    so overwhelming, to be sure, but very nearly so as the chances were that NO earth would ever rise
                    out of cosmic occurrences, that NO life would develop out of inorganic processes, that NO man would
                    emerge out of the evolution of animal life. <b>The decisive difference between the “infinite
                    improbabilities” on which the reality of our earthly life rests and the miraculous character
                    inherent in those events which establish historical reality is that, in the realm of human affairs,
                    we know the author of the “miracles.” It is men who perform them— men who because they have received
                    the twofold gift of freedom and action can establish a reality of their own.”</b></i></div>
