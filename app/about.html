        <div>
            This project is aiming for those who feel sometimes overwhelmed by the world around them . As volatility,
            uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity are rising, and affecting our daily motivation to stay active, pushing
            us
            towards apathetic behavior, which is expressed by moments of passivity during our daily interaction with
            computers. A work session of 3 hours in front of the screen is stretched and drawn into a 4-5 hours of
            screen
            time, as we check out our Facebook profile, watch a short Youtube, refresh the news or even move on to watch
            a
            full episode or two on Netflix. Is that what you aim to do with your leisure?
        </div>
        <div>
            Media and technology conglomerates are designing means of hooking our passive behavior and feed us with more
            content. <i>UN_APATHY MOVEMENT</i> is a tool for self reflection, aiming to untie these automated hooks, and
            allowing
            us to make sober decision of what to do with our spare time.

            <b>How does it work?</b>
        </div>
        <div>
            The tool is composed out of two actions: recognition and activation.
            The recognition console is tracking your body, head and gaze movement using your webcam, evaluating your
            screen
            time and counting your passive moments.
        </div>
        <div>
            As your apathy-bar reach 45 minutes of passive moments, the second action appears: It ia a call for a play.
            You
            are invited to learn how to juggle with 3 balls, to Hula Hoop or to slackline. Each of the activities can be
            learned step by step. Every 45 Minutes of full apathy bar, you should move and practice as much as you need
            to
            in order to feel reactivated. The apathy-bar restarts.

            <i>UN_APATHY MOVEMENT</i> is utilizing our body learning mechanisms in order to increase general self efficacy,
            decreasing apathetic behavior.
            Studies point out a two way channel between body and brain regarding physical activity and mood. It is
            studies
            that playful Physical activity that combines the moderate acquisition of a skill is particularly effective
            in
            increasing general self-efficacy and thus enabling us to return to action.
